What is Dophist Voice-Tag?
---
Dophist Voice-Tag(DVT) is a *speech-based* UI. It allows user to tag their speech to *any* operation on their smart-phone, such as:
* start an app
* make call to a friend
* turn on/off BLUE-TOOTH
* retrieve a photo from gallery
* start web browser to a bookmarked web page
etc.

How is it different?
---
1. DVT is local, it doesn't require internet connection.
    Almost *all* products on the market rely on internet connection, because speech recognition is a computation-intensive task, which has to be done in back-end servers.  
    However, DVT is designed to be a light-weight speech interface.  By use a voice tagging-retrieve mechanism, the recognition can be done locally.
2. DVT is fast.
    DVT reponds extremely fast because it is local, no time wasted to communicate with the back-end decoding cluster.
3. DVT is language independent.
    English, Chinese, Spanish etc, you can use whatever language you like, DVT is not picky.
4. DVT is accent independent.
    DVT don't care if you have a heavy accent, it just works fine.
5. DVT is highly customizable.
    As a tagging system, users choose what to tag, what not to tag.  In principle, *all* operation can be tagged with user's voice.  Tags can be easily added, removed.
6. DVT is accurate.
    The number of "most-frequent" operations on a mobile phone won't be large.  Say, under 100 tags, DVT's recognition accuracy can reach more than 95%.
