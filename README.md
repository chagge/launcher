What is Dophist Voice-Tag?
---
Dophist Voice-Tag(DVT) is a __speech-based__ UI for PC, mobile devices. It allows users to tag their speech to __any__ operation, such as:
* start an app/program
* open a PDF/word document
* start web browser and open a webpage
* make call to a friend
* turn on/off blue-tooth
* retrieve a photo from gallery

etc.

After this voice-to-operation binding, users can trigger the operation by speaking out the tagged speech.

How is it different?
---
1. Local, it doesn't require internet connection.  
    Almost __all__ products on the market rely on internet connection, because speech recognition is a computation-intensive task, which has to be done in server-end.  
    However, DVT is designed to be a light-weight speech UI.  A voice tagging-retrieving mechanism makes it possible to perform local recognition.
2. Fast.  
    DVT reponds extremely fast because it is local, no time is consumed to communicate with the servers.
3. Language independent.  
    English, Chinese, Spanish etc, you can use whatever language you like, DVT is not picky.
4. Accent independent.  
    DVT don't care if you have a heavy accent, it just works fine.
5. Highly customizable.  
    As a tagging system, users choose what to tag, what not to tag.  In principle, *all* operation can be tagged with user's voice.  Tags can be easily added, removed, and managed.
6. Accurate.  
    The number of "most-frequent" operations won't be large.  Say, 100 tags, DVT's recognition accuracy can reach more than 95%.
